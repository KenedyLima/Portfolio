          Wassup! My names is Kenedy Lima, 16 years old. Currently in High
          School
        </p>

        <p className="about-script">
          Right now i'm aiming to get my first job as a developer to init my
          professional career. As well as aggregate to our society by
          understanding it's current problems and developing solid, innovative
          and efficient solutions to it
        </p>
        <p className="about-script">
          I'm an individual who likes to think about all aspects of life, and
          discuss about it. Hoping to come up with a better solution or at least
          some answer to that bug
        </p>
        <p className="about-script">
          As a person born in Generation Z, googling probably is the top level
          skill that i have. Leveling up each day as my skills and knowledge
          improve in the IT area
        </p>
        <p className="about-script">
          For that reason, challenges are to me, if conquered, sets of new
          weapons and armors to my character. And for reaching and defeating the
          boss, i'm willing to accept any.
